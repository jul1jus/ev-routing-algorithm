# ev-routing-algorithm
Test data is a combination of OSM road network data + charging station data merged.
The Graph/Slovenia Dir is test Data that does not exceed the 100MB constraint of Github.

The Pareto objectives are:
• Distance: Total distance traveled
• Time: Total time traveled
• Energy consumed: Total energy consumed
• Charging Time: Total time spent charging



The program can be called using python routing_simple
